# Recipe Search Engine
[Live site here](https://recipe-search-engine.vercel.app/)

This is a search engine site I made to practice my skills between the study sessions, the main objectives were:
- Practicing with an API;
- Incorporating async functions to the code;
- Solidify my skills with Tailwind and Typescript;
- Use an open source of UI elements as basis to speed up the project;
- Create a logic for the javascript code that was robust and fast;
- Have data stored in a pratical manner by using Typescript Interfaces;

I'll give in some user stories of what the site might be used for:
- Search a list of recipes by filtering through name, cuisine, course, diet, intolerances and ingredients;
- Checkout the cooking steps and ingredients on a entire window by clicking on a recipe card;
- Favorite any recipe and have them displayed in the favorites bar;
- Have the favorites list be saved through different sessions;

The resources used were:
- The wonderful api by Spooncular [documentation here](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs); 
- Tailwind;
- Flowbite as base for some of the elements;
- Typescript;

All in all, I am happy with the result but everything I learned is invaluable, next time I want to step up the scale of the project, yes, but I want to take a more careful
and more-thoroughly-planned approach. First of all, I should create a flowchart for the logic; doing so would push me to have in mind all the different functions I would need
to create and be mindful of how they refer to each other. Async functions can be really easy if handled simply, but very often some code is let loose running and that causes
a mess difficult to unwrap. I tried to fragment the functions as much as possible but there is definetely room for improvement.
